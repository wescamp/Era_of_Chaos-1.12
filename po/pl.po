"Long before the arrival of humans, the ancient Argazar civilization "
"dominated Irdya. However, they lost a war with the world of Rythé, and found "
"themselves close to complete obliteration. But with their great mastery of "
"technology they were able to create the ultimate weapon: the "
"‘biomechanicals’, known in their ancient tongue as ‘Shaxthals’. These "
"invincible legionnaires combined the best and most lethal attributes of "
"every creature known by their creators. They served as protectors to the "
"Argazars, but could not guard them against Rythénian strategic weapons. The "
"Rythé desolated the lands of Irdya, destroyed the cities, and buried the "
"works of the Argazars.\n"
"\n"
"A remnant of the Argazars survived, buried deep in the very underground base "
"where shaxthal production was centered. The Rythénians thought their race "
"was gone, and abandoned Irdya putting an end to the war. No one knows what "
"events took place on the surface during the following eons, as the shattered "
"ecology of Irdya reknit itself. But what is known, is that the Argazars’ "
"creations rebelled against their masters. Whether this was due to a change "
"in the shaxthal creatures or the remaining Argazars themselves is not "
"known.\n"
"\n"
"Without the direction of the Argazars, the instincts of the Shaxthals "
"prevailed. Their drives were a strange and predatory mixture of those of "
"their biological ancestors and the warfare programming of their artificial "
"bodies. Those instincts drove them to consume the remains of the Argazar "
"civilization. Eventually they took the Argazars’ bodies and integrated them "
"into their own biomechanical plan. For they had been designed with an "
"assimilation system that allowed them to integrate into new environments, or "
"adapt the environments themselves to suit their needs, including any living "
"organisms that might inhabit them.\n"
"\n"
"The Shaxthals kept most of the technology of the Argazars, losing magic and "
"the advanced forms of biologic manipulation with which they had been "
"created. Reduced to barely a few dozen, the Argazars figured out a "
"biological weakness of their creations, a way to destroy most of the "
"Shaxthals en masse. All but a few of the strongest creatures perished. "
"Fatefully, the Argazars decided to keep them in cryogenic pods instead of "
"destroying them forever, as they thought there might be a last hope of using "
"reprogrammed shaxthals to rebuild their civilization at some point in the "
"future.\n"
"\n"
"That foolish thought condemned the Great Continent to an armageddon many "
"eons later.\n"
"\n"
"Long after the Fall of Wesnoth, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Chaos figured "
"out a way to resurrect the creatures, and reproduce their technology by "
"artificial means. The lorekeepers of the Empire even enabled them to them "
"able to rapidly reproduce by their own means. Thus modified, they became the "
"principal and most dreaded weapon of the Chaos Empire. After the defeat of "
"the Emperor, the Shaxthals were freed from their imprisonment in the dark "
"hives of the Heart, and adapted to the time-renewed ecology of the surface "
"world. They then began to prey on the speaking peoples of Irdya."

"The term 'vampire' is a word in an ancient dialect of the human language "
"that would mean 'corrupted blood' in the modern tongue. In reality, vampires "
"are not of a totally different race, but are the result of when a living "
"creature's blood is corrupted by a very powerful, arcane type of magic. All "
"vampires have red glowing eyes, white hair, pale skin, long fangs, and a "
"craving for the blood of other living creatures. In addition, this magic has "
"an effect on the creature so that it becomes similar to an undead creature; "
"therefore necromancy, poison, and abilities that drain will have no effect "
"on a vampire. Some of the more powerful vampires even have the ability to "
"transform into bats. Due to all of this, vampires are often classified as a "
"different race.\n"
"\n"
"As vampires have a strong craving for blood, they usually overwhelm an "
"already existing society mainly composed of living creatures, and build a "
"monarchy or an oligarchy over it; the living members of the society would be "
"subservient to the local vampires, and annually, five dozen of those members "
"would be sacrificed to the vampire population. Due to this practice, the "
"vampiric overlords encourage the subservient population to reproduce in "
"great numbers so that the number of members of the subservient population "
"remains plentiful. In return for compliance, the participating families get "
"a somewhat higher place in society. These societies work for two reasons, "
"one because of the threat the vampires present; two, the subservient members "
"benefit from this setup.\n"
"\n"
"Since blood is a very important part of vampire society, it is used as their "
"currency. Also, blood is often involved in their magic."
